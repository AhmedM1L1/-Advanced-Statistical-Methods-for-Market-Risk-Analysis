# Advanced Statistical Methods for Market Risk Analysis

### **Project Overview**
This project focuses on calculating various risk measures in financial markets, such as Value at Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES), and Hurst Exponent. The goal is to apply methods like  Empirical VaR, Non-Parametric VaR, Monte Carlo simulations, and extreme value theory (GEV) to analyze market risk. We also estimate the Almgren and Chriss model for liquidity risk and explore correlations in foreign exchange (FX) rates.

### **Project Objectives and Steps**
1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**:
   - Visualize and understand the data.
   - Clean the data by handling missing values and removing anomalies.
   - Ensure the data is in the correct format for analysis.

2. **Risk Calculation**:
   - Calculate **Empirical VaR** and **Non-Parametric VaR** using historical market data.
   - Compute **Expected Shortfall (ES)** based on the selected VaR model.
   - Use **Monte Carlo simulations** for VaR calculations on call options.

3. **Extreme Value Theory**:
   - Estimate the **Generalized Extreme Value (GEV)** parameters using **Pickands** and **Hill** estimators.
   - Calculate the **Extremal Index** using **Runs Declustering**.

4. **Almgren and Chriss Model**:
   - Implement the **Almgren and Chriss model** to estimate optimal trading strategies and liquidation costs.

5. **Multiresolution Analysis**:
   - Investigate multiresolution correlation between FX rate pairs.
   - Analyze the **Epps effect** and calculate the **Hurst Exponent** for different currency pairs.
